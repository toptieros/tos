# tOS — next steps

How the system works **today** is in [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md); this file tracks what's
**left** plus a terse log of what's landed. Every item keeps `make test` green (BIOS +
UEFI) before it's checked off.

**Status:** `make test` **41/41** (30 e2e journeys on BIOS + a UEFI subset 11) + **62 host
unit tests** (`make unit`, no QEMU). Pyramid policy in [`design/testing.md`](design/testing.md);
the phased plan in [`design/roadmap.md`](design/roadmap.md). tOS is early-to-mid development.

Legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` partial · `[⏸]` set aside (don't build unless asked).

## Open — the road ahead

### Toolkit & desktop UI
- [ ] **Files + Desktop suite (#10).** A shared `ui::FileView` powering both the Files window
  and a new bottom-pinned `WIN_DESKTOP` layer over `~/Desktop`: **multi-select** (Ctrl/Shift-click
  + rubber-band marquee — single-select today), **folder/multi-item copy-cut-paste** (today's
  `CLIP_FILE`-of-bytes can't hold a directory → path-reference clipboard + recursive `cp_r`),
  **rename**, context menus, and **drag-to-move** (needs DnD). **Keyboard shortcuts:** F2 rename,
  Ctrl+N new folder, Enter/Ctrl+O open, Delete (or Backspace) remove, Ctrl+A select-all,
  Backspace/Alt+← up a directory, plus the existing Ctrl+C/X/V — surfaced in the context menu and a
  menu bar (#6) so the accelerators show. → [`files-and-desktop.md`](design/files-and-desktop.md)
- [~] **App menus (#6).** **Done:** the app→WM protocol — `SYS_WIN_SETMENU` (a `struct winmenu`
  of up to 5 menus × 8 items), `SYS_WM_GETMENU`, a `WEV_MENU` event, and the `ui::Window`
  `menu_begin/menu_add/menu_item/menu_commit` + `on_menu()` API; twm draws a bar tile per menu
  (kind-3 dropdown) and routes a pick back to the app. **Per-item state + accelerators:** items
  carry `WMI_DISABLED`/`WMI_CHECKED` flags and a Ctrl-accelerator letter — the dropdown greys
  disabled rows (no hover, non-clickable), draws a leading ✓ for checked rows, and shows the
  accelerator (e.g. `^S`) right-aligned; the compositor intercepts `Ctrl+<letter>` for the focused
  window and fires the matching enabled item as a `WEV_MENU` (opt-in per declared menu, so
  menuless apps keep their raw Ctrl chords). Runtime toggles via `menu_set_checked/_set_enabled`.
  Notepad ships File [New ^N, Open ^O, Save ^S, Save As, Close Tab ^W] / Edit [Select All ^A,
  Undo ^Z, Redo ^Y] / View [✓ Status Bar]; **Files** ships File [New Folder ^N, Refresh] /
  Edit [Copy ^C, Cut ^X, Paste ^V, Delete] /
  Go [Up, Back, Forward]; **Terminal** (a raw-syscall app, proving the protocol isn't toolkit-only)
  ships Edit [Copy, Paste, Clear] with no Ctrl accelerators so the shell keeps ^C. **Left:**
  submenus (needs a `struct winmenu` ABI bump — deferred until something needs nesting). →
  [`ui.md`](design/ui.md)
- [ ] **Grow the toolkit + port apps.** A layout system; `fastfetch` and new apps onto the toolkit.
  (term + Files now carry real menu bars; the toolkit layout system is the remaining piece.)
- [~] **File open/save dialog (reusable picker).** **Done:** an in-process `ui::FileDialog` modal in
  the toolkit (Open + Save modes), built on the toolkit's own `ListView` + `TextField` so every app
  gets the same chrome — a **Favorites sidebar**, an **Up button**, a path bar, the directory list,
  and (Save) a name field — without re-implementing it. It honours system ownership (the Save button
  greys when the folder isn't user-writable) and raises a nested `ui::ConfirmDialog` **Replace /
  Cancel** when overwriting. Notepad wired it up: **File > Open…** (`^O`) and **File > Save As…**
  drive it; e2e `t_file_dialog`. The overwrite warning is **Replace / Keep Both / Cancel** — Keep
  Both dedupes to `name (N).ext` (`fd_dedup`) rather than clobbering. **Retired (2026-06-06):** the
  in-process modal looked *plain* (hand-drawn `fd_folder`/`fd_file` shapes, a re-implemented sidebar);
  it has been **deleted** and replaced by the **Files app launched as a picker process** (#11 below) so
  the dialog *is* Files (real `icons.h` icons, sidebar, breadcrumb, filter — like a Windows dialog
  resembles Explorer).
- [~] **File picker → Files-as-picker process (#11).** Retire `ui::FileDialog`; the system Open/Save
  picker becomes the **Files app** run in a *picker mode* with parameters, returning the chosen path
  to the caller. Mechanism extends the existing `/tmp/.open-doc` hand-off (`sys_open_with`): a request
  temp file in, a result temp file out, caller notices the picker exited via `trywait()`. Gets Files'
  whole design + feature set for free and can't visually drift from it. Full design (channels, SDK,
  picker-mode layout, modality, tests, risks) → [`file-picker.md`](design/file-picker.md). Phases,
  cheapest-first — **(1)–(4) DONE (2026-06-06); (5)–(6) left** (compositor/kernel work):
  - [x] **(1) SDK + codec.** `struct pick_req` + the key=value codec (`pickreq_encode`/`pickreq_parse` +
    the `ext`-filter `pickreq_ext_match`) live in pure header `user/lib/pickreq.h`; `sys_pick_begin` /
    `sys_pick_poll` (caller) + `sys_pick_req` (Files) in `user/lib/sys.{h,c}`; `/tmp/.picker-req`
    (key=value) in, `/tmp/.picker-res` (path or empty) out; begin unlinks stale res, poll wraps
    `trywait()`. Host unit test `tests/unit/t_pickreq.c` (encode/parse round-trip + ext predicate).
  - [x] **(2) Files picker mode.** Startup checks `sys_pick_req()` first; if set, a 560×420 dialog-shaped
    window + a picker footer (Name field on save, Cancel / Open·Save), extension filter (dirs always
    shown — `pickreq_ext_match`), ownership-greyed Save (`tos_may_write`+`getuid`), overwrite via the
    existing `ui::ConfirmDialog` (Replace / Keep Both / Cancel), New Folder kept / Delete·Open-With
    hidden, no menu bar. Writes the result + exits on pick/cancel/close. Logs `[files] picker …` /
    `[files] picked …` / `[files] pick cancel`. Open + save both done.
  - [x] **(3) Migrate notepad + tests.** `open_open()`/`save_as()` → `sys_pick_begin` (`start_pick`);
    `on_tick` polls `sys_pick_poll`; the embedded `ui::FileDialog` is gone. New e2e `t_file_picker`
    (save-with-rename + overwrite/Keep-Both in the picker window + open-mode round-trip);
    `t_notepad_edit_save`/`t_notepad_undo`/`t_notepad_guard`/`t_app_menu` rewired via `_accept_save_picker`
    to the `[files] picker/picked …` markers (read-back persistence checks kept).
  - [x] **(4) Delete `ui::FileDialog`** + its `fd_*` glyph/dedup helpers — done; one picker, no dead code.
  - [ ] **(5) Modality polish.** Compositor `WIN_MODAL` + `wininfo.parent`: keep the picker above its
    parent, dim the parent with the Launchpad-style scrim, route input to the modal, restore focus on
    close. (v1 ships as an ordinary top-level window; this only stops clicking the caller underneath.)
  - [ ] **(6) Hardening.** Pid-namespace the temp files (`/tmp/.picker-<pid>.req/.res`) for concurrent
    pickers; add `SYS_GETPID` if userspace lacks it. → [`file-picker.md`](design/file-picker.md)
- [x] **Notepad redesign: tabs + session autosave (#5).** **DONE** — Notepad is now a tabbed editor.
  - [x] **Close UX (refined per use)** — closing the **window** never prompts: the session autosave
    already holds every tab + its unsaved contents, so `on_close` just flushes the latest draft and
    exits (a relaunch restores everything). Closing a **tab** (the tab's × or **File > Close Tab ^W**)
    is what asks about unsaved work — a dirty tab raises the modal **Save / Discard / Cancel** sheet
    (`ui::ConfirmDialog`); **Discard** drops it, **Save** on a named tab writes to its path then
    closes, and **Save** on a never-saved tab opens the picker to choose where (the tab closes once
    the pick succeeds). Explicitly closing the *last* tab clears the draft store so a relaunch starts
    fresh. e2e `t_notepad_guard`.
  - [x] **Tabs** — the top filename field is gone; each note is a tab in a `TabBar` strip (active
    highlighted, dirty shows a dot, each has a × to close) + a trailing **`+`** (also **File > New /
    ^N**); switch/close per tab; one shared `editor` swaps the active tab's text in/out (a `loading`
    flag stops a load from dirtying the tab). The active tab shows the note's name. *(The window
    title bar stays "Notepad" — there's no win-set-title syscall yet; the tab is the per-note name.)*
    *(Per-tab undo history isn't preserved across a switch — acceptable for v1.)* Screenshot-verified.
  - [x] **Session autosave** — a new `Window::on_tick()` hook drives a periodic draft (~1.8 s, only
    when the session changed) of every tab's text + the layout (open tabs, active one, per-tab
    name/dirty, the untitled counter) to `/Users/user/.cache/notepad/` (`session` + `tab<i>`). On a
    bare relaunch Notepad rebuilds the whole session — even never-saved notes. Two-boot e2e
    `t_notepad_session`.
  - [x] **Save / Open flow** — the reusable picker is wired as **File > Open…** (`^O`) / **File >
    Save As…**. **Save / ^S** writes a named note straight to its path; a **never-saved** note opens
    the picker (rooted at `~/Documents`) so you always choose where the first time — a draft sitting
    in the autosave store doesn't count as "saved". e2e `t_notepad_edit_save` (Save→picker→accept) +
    `t_notepad_undo` (first save→picker, later saves write direct). → [`ui.md`](design/ui.md)

### Global text-interaction contract
The toolkit owns the in-window text contract: anything in `TextField` is inherited by every
toolkit app for free. **Done:** blink caret, drag-select, Ctrl+A, double-click word-select,
Ctrl+←/→ word-jump, Ctrl+Backspace/Delete word-delete, Delete, shift-select, **undo/redo
(Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y)**. **Left:**
- [ ] **I-beam cursor over selectable text.** Blocked on an app→compositor cursor-shape protocol
  (twm composites the cursor and doesn't know widget regions).
- [ ] **Primary selection + cross-app text drag.** Blocked on the DnD protocol.

### Input / event foundations
- [ ] **Drag-and-drop protocol.** A source starts a drag with a **typed payload** (file path /
  text / image bytes); the compositor drags a ghost + hit-tests drop targets; drop delivers the
  payload (a `WEV_DROP`). Unlocks Files drag-to-move, the desktop, cross-app text drag, and Pocket
  Dimension. (Richer key events — modifier flags, `WEV_KEYUP`, `WEV_MOUSE_SHIFT` — are done.)

### System & security
- [~] **System ownership (#1).** **Done:** tosfs v3 carries a per-entry `owner`; tasks carry a
  `uid` (init=system, the desktop session drops to user); the mutating fs syscalls enforce
  `tos_may_write()`; the shell prints `permission denied (system file)` and ships an `id` builtin.
  **Remaining (folded into the Files suite below):** the Files/desktop **lock badge** + greyed
  actions on system-owned items (reads `fstat.owner`). → [`system-ownership.md`](design/system-ownership.md)
- [ ] **Capability sandbox.** Wire the manifest `caps` field to a per-task capability set checked
  at the syscall boundary (fs jails, spawn/window/notify gating). → [`app-runtime.md`](design/app-runtime.md)
- [~] **Ctrl+C/X/V everywhere.** Landed in `TextField`, the terminal (Ctrl+Shift+C/X/V), and Files
  (files). Remaining: **folders** — folded into the Files + Desktop suite above.
- [⏸] **Pocket Dimension (Super+D).** A left-edge per-session shelf of stashed typed payloads.
  Don't implement unless explicitly requested; needs DnD.

### Platform / runtime / storage
- [⏸] **Real shell + scripting.** Replace `shell.c`'s hardcoded `if/else` dispatch with a real
  lexer/parser + exec model (quoting, `$VAR`/env, pipes, redirection, `;`/`&&`/`||`, globbing,
  background `&`, scripts). First step: drop `help`, move demo/diagnostic builtins to `/System/bin`
  programs. Big effort; **not this round** unless asked.
- [ ] **Userspace runtime + SDK sysroot.** sysroot + `tos-cc`/`tos-c++`; a hosted C++ runtime
  (STL/exceptions/RTTI/unwind); `libposix`; a QPA-style framebuffer/input shim. The line between
  "teaching OS" and "runs third-party software." → [`app-porting.md`](design/app-porting.md)
- [ ] **Installer (live → install).** Raw block-write to a target disk, in-OS mkfs/partitioning,
  copy `/System`+`/Apps`, seed `/Users` + registry. Start on virtio-blk/ATA-slave. → [`installation.md`](design/installation.md)
- [ ] **Device drivers (Phase 4).** virtio-blk → AHCI/SATA+DMA → NVMe → GPT/ESP(FAT) writer → USB
  (xHCI+HID+MSC) → ACPI (uACPI/LAI) → virtio-net/e1000 + TCP/IP. GPU accel is VM-only. → [`roadmap.md`](design/roadmap.md)
- [ ] **Growable filesystem.** Files are contiguous and a metadata change rewrites the whole slot
  table; the partition is fixed-size. Want extent/indirect blocks, a runtime-sized partition, and a
  journaled table.
- [~] **Terminal scrollback.** Wheel + Shift-PgUp/PgDn over a 256-row ring done; future: a
  configurable ring size.

### Smaller ideas
- _(nothing queued right now)_

## Done (changelog)

Terse one-liners, newest first; the prose lives in git history + PROJECT.md.

- **Incremental directory flush — kills the notepad-autosave freeze (2026-06-06).** Found the real
  culprit behind "saving freezes the desktop": `flush_super()` rewrote the *entire* tosfs directory
  table on every file create/delete/rename/close. On today's 4096-sector disk that table is
  **378 sectors / 189 KB**, so each `close()` blasted 189 KB through polled PIO (≈97k VM-exits under
  KVM, ~15-20 ms on the single core) just to record one changed entry — and a single notepad autosave
  closes one draft file *per open tab* plus a session file, i.e. several × 189 KB per idle pause.
  This dwarfs the file data itself and is what the preemptible-syscall work (2026-06-05) couldn't
  cure: it made the write *preemptible* but not *smaller*. **Fix:** `flush_super_ent(slot)` writes
  only the 1-2 sectors that hold the one entry a mutating op changed (every op flushes a single slot
  immediately, so this is byte-identical on disk) — a save's metadata I/O drops ~190× (189 KB → ≤1 KB),
  making an autosave imperceptible. Pure kernel change in `fs.c`; build clean, unit 62/62, e2e 37/37
  (the 4 fails were pre-existing load flakes, all green re-run alone). Caveat: this does not make I/O
  *async*, so a very large file's *data* write still scales with its size — the async/DMA + write-back
  cache cure in Known issues remains the full fix for big writes.

- **Preemptible syscalls — long disk ops no longer freeze the machine; short writes still hitch (2026-06-05).** The
  "typing in notepad freezes the entire OS / the mouse locks up" report. Root cause (measured on
  KVM, where each 16-bit `rep insw/outsw` word is a VM-exit, so a 128-sector PIO read ≈ 20M cycles
  ≈ 5–7 ms): **every syscall ran with interrupts disabled** — the `int 0x80` gate is an *interrupt*
  gate and `isr_common` never `sti`'d — and `fs_lock`/`ata_lock` were `spin_lock_irqsave`, so a slow
  polled-PIO disk transfer held IF=0 for its whole duration. On a single core the timer then never
  fired, so the scheduler never ran the compositor and the cursor locked up for the length of the
  transfer (notepad autosaving on every typing pause = repeated freezes). **Fix:** (1) run syscalls
  **preemptibly** — `sti` in the `0x80` dispatch; the scheduler already parks a half-finished kernel
  frame per task (`tasks[].krsp` in `do_switch`), and every kernel lock is `irqsave`, so a timer
  preemption can never land inside a critical section. (2) New **`spin_lock_preempt` /
  `spin_unlock_preempt`** (`kernel/arch/spinlock.h`) — a mutual-exclusion lock that leaves IF
  untouched — for `fs_lock` + `ata_lock`, so the disk transfer itself stays preemptible. (3) **Moved
  all disk I/O out of `sched_lock`**: `sched_exit` flushes+closes files *before* the lock, and
  `sched_spawn`/`sched_exec` build the address space + read the ELF *before* the lock — this keeps
  those paths preemptible (also fixing a pre-existing multi-ms **app-launch freeze**) and avoids a
  single-CPU deadlock (an IF=0 spinner on a preempt-lock held by a preempted task). (4) Preemptible
  syscalls exposed one **lost-wakeup**: `SYS_READ` checked the input ring empty and then blocked as
  two steps, so a keystroke could arrive + wake between them and be lost — the check+block is now
  interrupt-atomic. (5) Notepad autosave debounce widened (~0.6 s → ~1.3 s idle). `make test`
  40–41/41 (the lone miss a known compositor toast-timing flake, green in isolation) + 62 unit.
  **What this does NOT fix (verified by the user — the cursor still freezes on save):** a syscall is
  only actually *preempted* if it spans a **10 ms** (100 Hz) timer tick. App launches / large reads
  (tens of ms) now do, so they no longer freeze — but a **short synchronous write that finishes
  inside one tick still blocks everything, cursor included**, for its duration, because the timer
  never fires mid-write. notepad's autosave is a handful of small writes (~a few ms) that mostly
  complete within a tick, so it **still freezes the cursor briefly on every save**. The fix is
  correct architecture (and removes a deadlock + the multi-ms launch freeze) but is the wrong layer
  for the autosave hitch — the real cure is **async/DMA disk + a write-back cache** so the UI task
  never blocks on the platter. See Known issues.
- **Damage-rect presents + notepad save/close fixes (2026-06-03).** Fixed a notepad lag regression
  (hovering the tab strip while typing pinned the loop at the frame cap, each frame re-blitting the
  whole client surface). New **`win_present_rect(id,x,y,w,h)`** syscall (#66): the kernel accumulates
  a per-window damage rect (union of partial presents, reset each compositor snapshot; full
  `win_present` ⇒ whole-surface), carried in `struct wmwin`, and twm composites **only** that
  sub-rect instead of the whole window. The toolkit tracks a damage rect per frame — `invalidate()`
  = whole, `invalidate(rect)` = union; hover state, the blinking caret, and `TextField` typing now
  invalidate just their widget's rect, and `Window::redraw()` clips + `win_present_rect`s that band
  (skipping non-overlapping widgets). Backward-compatible: a full present is just a whole-rect
  damage, so every existing app is unchanged. **Save bug:** quitting with a dirty background tab used
  to silently drop it (quit-Save only wrote the active tab). **Close/save UX reworked per use:**
  closing the **window** never prompts (the autosave draft already holds every tab + unsaved
  contents — `on_close` flushes + exits, relaunch restores); closing a **tab** is what guards, and
  **Save** on a never-saved tab (or **Ctrl+S** on one) opens the **picker** to choose where (a draft
  ≠ saved); closing the *last* tab clears the draft store. **Autosave debounced** so a disk write
  never stalls active typing (flush after ~0.6 s idle, or a ~3 s backstop). Tests updated
  (`t_notepad_edit_save`/`_undo`/`_guard`/`t_app_menu` now drive the picker). Screenshot-verified
  (hover-while-typing clean, picker renders). BIOS 30/30 + UEFI 11/11 + 62 unit.
- **Notepad tabs + session autosave #5 (2026-06-03).** Notepad is now a tabbed editor. The top
  filename field is gone; each note is a tab in an app-local `TabBar` strip (active accent-edged,
  dirty shows a dot, each with a ×) + a trailing `+`; **File > New / ^N** opens a fresh untitled tab
  (no guard — opening a tab can't lose data), **File > Close Tab / ^W** (or the ×) closes one. One
  shared `editor` swaps the active tab's text in/out, gated by a `loading` flag so a load doesn't
  dirty the tab; a `Tab{name,named,dirty,text,caret}` model holds the rest. The unsaved-changes guard
  moved from New to **tab/window close** (`t_notepad_guard` reworked: two dirty tabs, Discard one +
  Save the other — which also proves per-tab content isolation). **Session autosave:** a new toolkit
  `Window::on_tick()` hook drives a periodic draft (~1.8 s, only when changed) of every tab's text +
  the layout to `~/.cache/notepad/` (`session` + `tab<i>`); a bare relaunch rebuilds the whole
  session, even never-saved notes — two-boot e2e `t_notepad_session` (restore markers carry each
  tab's loaded byte count). **Save** is a quick-save (named → its path; untitled → `~/Documents`),
  **Save As…**/**Open…** use the picker. Window title stays "Notepad" (no set-title syscall yet);
  per-tab undo isn't kept across a switch (v1). Screenshot-verified. BIOS 30/30 + UEFI 11/11 + 62 unit.
- **Reusable file picker `ui::FileDialog` #4 (2026-06-03).** A new toolkit modal — the system's one
  Open/Save browser. Built on the toolkit's own `ListView` + `TextField` (no atlas dep — lean vector
  folder/file glyphs), so any app gets the same chrome for free: a **Favorites sidebar**
  (Home/Desktop/Documents/Downloads/Pictures/Applications/Computer), an **Up button** + a path bar
  (right-truncated), the dirs-first directory list, and — in **Save** mode — a name field that opens
  pre-filled + select-all'd so the first keystroke replaces the suggestion. Added LAST to a Window
  (like `ConfirmDialog`), it grabs focus, forwards keys to the embedded name field (a new
  `TextField::force_focus` keeps its caret blinking while the modal owns focus), and swallows stray
  clicks. **Open** picks an existing file (the OK button greys until a file is selected; activating a
  folder navigates); **Save** browses + names, greys OK when the folder isn't user-writable
  (`tos_may_write` via `kernel/fs/perm.h`), and on an overwrite raises a nested **Replace / Keep
  Both / Cancel** `ui::ConfirmDialog` — **Keep Both** dedupes to `name (N).ext` (`fd_dedup`) instead
  of clobbering. `on_pick(ctx, path)` returns the chosen absolute path (or nullptr on Cancel);
  markers `[filedialog] open …/cd …/pick …/cancel`. **Notepad** wired it up: File > Open… (`^O`)
  loads a note, File > Save As… writes one (File menu is now New/Open/Save/Save As). e2e
  `t_file_dialog` (Save As → type a name → Enter → read back; then Save As the same name → Keep Both
  → `picked (2).txt`); screenshot-verified (Open + Save + the 3-button overwrite warning). BIOS 29/29
  + UEFI 11/11 + 62 unit.
- **Notepad default save location = Documents (2026-06-03).** A bare note name now resolves to
  `/Users/user/Documents/<name>` instead of the home root, so saved notes stop littering `$HOME`;
  `resolve_path` `mkdir`s `Documents` defensively (init already seeds it). Absolute paths are
  untouched. The three e2e notepad checks (`t_notepad_edit_save`, `t_notepad_undo`,
  `t_notepad_guard`) follow the path to `/Users/user/Documents/untitled.txt` and read it back as
  `cat Documents/untitled.txt`. When the file picker (#4) lands, this becomes its default folder.
  BIOS 28/28 + UEFI 11/11 + 62 unit (no test count change — paths shifted, not added).
- **Notepad unsaved-changes guard + reusable ConfirmDialog #5 (2026-06-03).** New (and the
  compositor's Close button) on a dirty buffer no longer silently nukes it. New toolkit widget
  `ui::ConfirmDialog`: a modal sheet (dim scrim + centred card + up to 3 buttons, the primary
  accent-filled on the right) that grabs keyboard focus while open (Enter = primary, swallows the
  rest) and captures every click (added last to the window, rect = whole window, like Files' Popup);
  `on_choice(ctx, idx)` returns the button index. Window gained an `on_close()` veto hook (return
  false to keep the window open). Notepad tracks a `dirty` flag via `editor.on_change`, splits
  `new_note()` into a guarded entry + `do_new()`, and defers New/Quit until the **Save / Discard /
  Cancel** answer (Save writes first). The dialog reports its button centres (`[ui] dlgbtn i x y`,
  client-relative) so tests can click them. e2e `t_notepad_guard` exercises the Discard (click) and
  Save (Enter) paths; screenshot-verified. The reusable dialog also unblocks the file dialog's
  overwrite warning (#4). BIOS 28/28 + UEFI 11/11 + 62 unit.
- **Terminal + Files ported onto the app-menu API #6 (2026-06-03).** Two more apps now carry real
  menu bars. **Files** (a `ui::Window`) declares File [New Folder ^N, Refresh] / Edit [Copy ^C, Cut
  ^X, Paste ^V, Delete] / Go [Up, Back, Forward] via `menu_begin/menu_add/menu_item/menu_commit`,
  routed in `on_menu` to the same actions the toolbar + right-click already run; the ^C/^X/^V/^N
  accelerators are intercepted by the compositor and arrive as `WEV_MENU` picks (`[files] menu m i`
  trace). **Terminal** — a raw-syscall app, *not* the toolkit — builds a `struct winmenu` by hand
  and calls `win_setmenu(win, &m)`, then handles `WEV_MENU` in its event loop: Edit [Copy, Paste,
  Clear] with **no** Ctrl accelerators on purpose, so a plain ^C still reaches the shell as an
  interrupt (`[term] menu i` trace). Proves the menu protocol is app-agnostic, not toolkit-only.
  e2e `t_files_menu` (Ctrl+N → New Folder lands on disk) + `t_term_menu` (click Edit > Clear →
  WEV_MENU); both menu bars screenshot-verified. BIOS 27/27 + UEFI 11/11 + 62 unit. Still left
  under #6: submenus (a `struct winmenu` ABI bump, deferred until a use appears).
- **TextField undo/redo — the global text contract (2026-06-03).** Every toolkit text field now
  inherits Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y. `TextField` carries two bounded ring stacks of insert/delete span
  records (`{op, pos, span text, caret-before}`); `ins`/`del_range` record each mutation, `undo`/
  `redo` pop one stack and apply the inverse (which re-records onto the other, so the chain is fully
  reversible) and restore the caret. A run of single-char typing or backspacing **coalesces** into
  one step (one Ctrl+Z drops the whole word), broken by a newline or a caret jump/click; a fresh
  edit clears the redo stack; `set_text` resets the history. The subtle merge rule is factored into
  a pure `user/lib/editlog.h` (`el_coalesce_kind`) shared by the widget and the new host unit test
  `t_editlog` (16 checks). Notepad's **Edit > Undo** (was declared-but-disabled) is enabled with
  accelerator `^Z` and a **Redo `^Y`** item added — the compositor routes the chords as menu picks
  for the focused window, and the same raw `^Z`/`^Y` bytes drive undo/redo in any non-menu app
  (Spotlight, Files name fields). e2e `t_notepad_undo` (type → Ctrl+Z → 0-byte save → Ctrl+Y →
  8-byte save → read back). BIOS 25/25 + UEFI 11/11 + 62 unit; screenshot-verified (Edit dropdown
  shows enabled Undo ^Z / Redo ^Y).
- **User-program heap — confirmed already done (2026-06-03).** The "a program is its static image
  + stack" note was stale: `user/lib/libc.c` already ships a full growable heap over `SYS_MMAP`
  (`malloc/free/realloc/calloc`, an address-sorted free list with first-fit + split + boundary
  coalescing, arena grown in ≥1 MiB mmap chunks) — `operator new`/`delete` (crt.cpp) sit on it, and
  twm/Files/ui all allocate through it. An mmap-backed heap supersedes a `sbrk`; the stale "smaller
  idea" bullet was removed. (Making the terminal scrollback ring runtime-sized still sits under
  *Terminal scrollback*.)
- **LAPIC timer calibrated against the PIT (2026-06-03).** The AP preemption timer was a magic
  QEMU-tuned count (`1000000`, ~62.5 Hz). `lapic_timer_calibrate(hz)` (apic.c) now measures the
  local timer's real rate over a PIT-channel-2 one-shot window (gated + polled via port 0x61 bit5,
  so no IRQs — it runs at boot with interrupts still off) and returns the divide-by-16 count for a
  defined rate; `smp_init` calls it once on the BSP (`LAPIC_PREEMPT_HZ` = 100, matching the BSP's
  PIT tick) and the APs reuse the result. Implausible readings / a watchdog timeout fall back to
  the old fixed count, so the worst case is unchanged. Measured count 626723 on QEMU (≈625000
  expected: 1 GHz APIC ÷16 ÷100) — `[smp] lapic timer calibrated: count N (~100 hz preempt)`.
- **Live resize + reflow — verified done (2026-06-03).** twm already streams `WEV_RESIZE` to the
  app as the grip is dragged (throttled to >7px) and sends the exact size on release (twm.c live-
  resize block); the terminal recomputes its grid via `setup_surface` and the toolkit's multiline
  `TextField` re-wraps from the current width on each redraw, so content reflows **live**, not on
  mouse-up. Screenshot-verified (notepad text re-wrapped as the window narrowed). A separate XOR
  "ghost outline" is unnecessary now that the content itself resizes live; the stale open bullet
  was removed.
- **App-menu accelerators + checkmarks + disabled items #6 (2026-06-03).** `struct winmenu`
  items gained a `flags` byte (`WMI_DISABLED`/`WMI_CHECKED`) and an `accel` letter. `ui::Window`'s
  `menu_item(label, accel=0, flags=0)` plus `menu_set_checked/_set_enabled/_is_checked` declare and
  live-toggle them. twm's dropdown greys disabled rows (no hover, ignored clicks), draws a leading
  ✓ for checked rows (a two-stroke `draw_check`, no line primitive), and right-aligns the `^X`
  accelerator hint; the key loop intercepts `Ctrl+<letter>` for the focused window and fires the
  matching enabled item as a `WEV_MENU` (opt-in per declared menu — menuless apps keep raw chords;
  Backspace/Tab/Enter/Esc arrive without Ctrl so never match). `menu_sig` folds in flags+accel so a
  runtime toggle re-publishes. Notepad now ships File [New ^N, Save ^S] / Edit [Select All ^A, Undo
  disabled] / View [✓ Status Bar]. `[twm] accel <L> <m> <i>` trace; `t_app_menu` extended with the
  Ctrl+N accelerator path. Build + unit (46) + screenshot-verified.
- **App menus #6 (2026-06-02).** App→WM menu protocol: `struct winmenu` (≤5 menus × ≤8 items) set
  via `SYS_WIN_SETMENU`, read by the compositor via `SYS_WM_GETMENU`, with `WEV_MENU` delivering a
  pick back to the app. `ui::Window` gained `menu_begin/menu_add/menu_item/menu_commit` + an
  `on_menu(menu,item)` hook; twm fetches the focused window's menu each frame, draws a tile per
  top-level menu after the app name (a kind-3 dropdown), and posts `WEV_MENU` on a pick. Notepad
  declares File [New, Save] / Edit [Select All]. `[twm] appmenu`/`menu app` traces; `t_app_menu`.
- **Maximize hides both bars + hover-reveal (2026-06-02).** Fullscreen (green button /
  double-click title / new **Super+F**) now makes the client fill the **whole** screen (`W×H`,
  was `W×(H−TH)`); the window's own title bar becomes a sliding overlay that hides **with** the
  menu bar as one "top group". A top-edge hover reveals both together and HOLDS while the cursor
  stays in the revealed band (so you can reach the traffic lights); diving into the content
  retracts them. Centralized window geometry in `is_fs`/`client_rect`/`outer_rect`/`in_client`
  helpers + `fs_titlebar_y`; rewired every compositor input path. `[twm] fullscreen <t> 0|1` and
  `[twm] topbar shown|hidden` traces; `t_fullscreen`. 34/34 + 46 unit.
- **System ownership #1 (2026-06-02).** tosfs bumped to **v3**: every entry carries an `owner`
  uid (+ a reserved `mode` byte); `mkfs` stamps `/Users` + `/tmp` = user, the rest = system
  (shared rule in `kernel/fs/perm.h`, unit-tested). Tasks carry a `uid` (inherited on fork); init
  (pid 1) is `system` and drops the whole desktop session to `user` via a new `SYS_SETUID` before
  launching twm. The mutating fs syscalls (unlink/open-create/mkdir/rmdir/rename) enforce
  `tos_may_write()`, so the user can no longer delete or modify `/System` or `/Apps`; reads/exec
  stay open. `SYS_GETUID` + `fstat.owner` exposed; shell `rm` prints `permission denied (system
  file)` and gains an `id` builtin. Unit `t_perm` (18) + e2e `t_system_ownership`. 33/33 + 46 unit.
- **Notification click routing (2026-06-02).** `struct notif` gained a `target` field; new
  `notify_to(title, body, target)` (plain `notify()` posts an empty target = no routing).
  Clicking a toast body or a notification-center row (`notif_activate` + `nc_row_at`) focuses the
  target app's window (restoring a minimized one) or launches it from the catalog; `[twm] notif
  open <app>` trace. Shell `notify <app> <body>` posts a routed toast. `t_notif_click_routing`.
- **Dock pinned | running divider (2026-06-02).** `rebuild_dock()` records the boundary index
  (`dock_runsep`) after the last pinned tile; `draw_dock()` draws a faint 1px vertical separator
  in the gap before the first running-unpinned tile, shown only when one exists. `[twm] docksep`
  trace; asserted in `t_notepad_edit_save`.
- **Launchers mutually exclusive (2026-06-02).** `dismiss_launchers(except)` at every launcher
  summon path (the three Super hotkeys + the dock Launchpad button) closes the other two, so
  Spotlight can't float over the clipboard/Launchpad. Focus telemetry now tracks the window
  *id* too, so a freed slot reused by a new window in the same frame still reports the focus
  change + repaints chrome; new `[twm] unmap <title>` trace. `t_launchers_exclusive`. 31/31.
- **UEFI boot fixed above 4 GiB (2026-06-02).** The loader only identity-mapped 0–4 GiB, so at
  `MEM ?= 8G` OVMF's high-loaded app `#PF`'d on the CR3 switch; it now reads the UEFI
  `GetMemoryMap` and maps all of RAM (`ram_top`/`build_tables`). `t_ram_scales` gained a 6G case +
  runs on UEFI. 30/30.
- **Settings app uses Lucide glyphs (2026-06-02).** `ui::Button` gained optional `icon`/`value`;
  new `tools/genglyphs.py` → `user/lib/glyphs.h` bakes a reusable Lucide app-glyph set.
- **Multi-region frame pool across the 4 GiB hole (2026-06-02).** `vmm` reads the e820 map
  (`fw_cfg`), maps only real RAM + skips the PCI hole, uses RAM above 4 GiB; `MEM ?= 8G`; `memtest`.
- **Notification toast: shadow-smear fixed + Lucide `x` dismiss + global `ugfx_set_shadows`
  (`ui.shadows` key) (2026-06-02).**
- **Files Ctrl+C/X/V (files) over the clip ring + context menu (2026-06-02).**
- **Shift-select completed — Shift+click via `WEV_MOUSE_SHIFT` (2026-06-02).**
- **Terminal Shift-PgUp/PgDn scrollback paging (2026-06-02).**
- **Notification expand: Lucide chevron + per-row expand in the center (2026-06-02).**
- **Notification-center dirty-rect / shadow-halo fixes (2026-06-02).**
- **Crisp icons: premultiplied resampler + 128px masters + Lucide bar glyphs; tosfs 1→2 MiB
  (2026-06-01).**
- **Test suite rebuilt as a pyramid: 49 e2e → 19 e2e + 28 unit; `textutil.h` (2026-06-01).**
- **macOS-style Alt-Tab switcher overlay (#7, 2026-06-01).**
- **Terminal copy-path test coverage — `t_term_copy` (2026-06-01).**
- **Notification QoL: hover-pause, collapsible toast, slide-into-open-center, Clear (2026-06-01).**
- **Notifications / toasts: `notify()` → `SYS_NOTIFY` → toast + center + bell (2026-06-01).**
- **Status-bar cluster + registry-driven clock (2026-06-01).**
- **Single-sourced shadow-halo extents via `ugfx_elevation_extent` (2026-06-01).**
- **Global ScrollBar: `ugfx_scroll_thumb` + `ui::ScrollBar` (Files/Spotlight thumbs) (2026-06-01).**
- **Notepad / global text editing (#5): blink caret, word-select, word-jump/delete, Delete
  (2026-06-01).**
- **Rounded, bigger search bars (#14, 2026-06-01).**
- **Frosted-glass UI pass: `ugfx_frost` blur under bar/dock/CC/Launchpad (2026-05-31).**
- **Launchpad polish (#11): centred grid + type-to-filter (2026-05-31).**
- **Draggable scroll indicator (#12, 2026-05-31).**
- **Spotlight keyboard QoL (#13): arrows/Tab walk results (2026-05-31).**
- **Scroll-wheel support (#9): `WEV_SCROLL` (2026-05-30).**
- **Launchpad/Spotlight real icons (#2), dynamic dock (#3), Hello removed (#4) (2026-05-30).**
- **Window UX: single-instance `summon`, Super+V clipboard, Super+Tab switcher (2026-05-30).**
- **Hierarchical filesystem (tosfs v2, parent-indexed) + Dolphin-style Files app.**
- **Compositor desktop: `kernel/ipc.c` protocol; twm back-buffered compositor; `term`; fastfetch.**
- **C++ application SDK: freestanding crt + heap + libc + `ulib`/`sys` + `ui::` toolkit.**
- **UI-modernization pass: hover feedback, AA borders / state layers / elevation (2026-05-29).**
- **macOS-style system layout: `/System` `/Apps` `/Users`; registry; real cursors; fullscreen.**
- **Kernel foundations: delete+free-map, per-task fd tables, ELF loader, MBR, sleep, fork/exec +
  pids/wait/zombies, fine-grained SMP, RTC/PCI/speaker/reboot, VBE fb, AA system font, test suite.**

## Known issues (history, not blocking)

- **BIOS real-mode load envelope `#UD` — FIXED (2026-05-29).** The chunked disk-read loop ran
  `mov ah,0x42` before `push ax`, baking `0x42` into the sectors-remaining counter; one-line
  ordering fix in `boot/stage1.asm`. (Debug via `-d int,cpu_reset` + `pmemsave` dumps; gdb breaks
  in the boot sector are unreliable — the loop self-modifies the DAP page.)
- **Flaky UEFI tests under host load — hardened (2026-05-29).** Tight inject schedules can outrun
  OVMF+TCG; the harness now retries (`t_mouse` re-injects, `line_for` retypes). Environmental.
- **tmpfs scratch leak — FIXED.** `Tos.stop()` removes the per-run scratch disk / OVMF-vars / serial
  log it created (a caller-supplied scratch is left alone).
- **Synchronous disk I/O can still freeze the desktop on *large* writes — MOSTLY FIXED for the
  everyday case (2026-06-06).** The headline symptom (notepad autosave freezes the cursor) is fixed:
  it was dominated not by the file data but by `flush_super()` rewriting the whole **189 KB** directory
  table on every close — now an incremental per-entry flush of ≤1 KB (see Done). What *remains* is the
  residual architecture: writes are still **synchronous polled PIO**, and a syscall is only preempted
  if it spans a **10 ms** timer tick, so writing a genuinely large file's *data* (tens of KB+) still
  busy-waits the single core for its duration (every transferred word is a VM-exit under KVM; raising
  `TIMER_HZ` barely helps — a 3 ms write still freezes ~3 ms at 1 kHz). For typical notes this is now
  imperceptible; the full cure for big writes is still, in order of payoff: **(a)** an **async / DMA**
  block driver (virtio-blk or AHCI+DMA — see the Phase-4 driver item) so a transfer is one descriptor,
  not thousands of `inb`/`outb`; **(b)** a **write-back buffer cache** that returns immediately and
  flushes on idle/sync, so the app never blocks on the platter; **(c)** make the writer not block the
  UI thread (background the flush). Cheaper palliatives already in place: autosave is debounced to a
  real ~1.3 s pause and only drafts. (More CPU cores would let *other* tasks run during a writer's
  blocking write, but won't stop the *writer* itself from hitching — only async I/O does that.)
